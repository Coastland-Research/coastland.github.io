Colours represent whether or not the stream qualified for analysis in this study. Solid vertical lines denote the establishment of the Great Bear Rainforest Special Protection Area (GBR SPA) in 2007 and dashed vertical lines represent the cutoff for the current generation included in the analyses. 2.1 Summary Table Species Included in analysis Number of streams Chinook Y 70 Chum Y 198 Coho Y 202 Pink (Even years) Y 193 Pink (Odd years) Y 202 Sockeye Y 48 Chinook N 48 Chum N 278 Coho N 296 Pink (Even years) N 275 Pink (Odd years) N 252 Sockeye N 69 2.2 Chinook 2.3 Chum 2.4 Coho 2.5 Pink (Even years) 2.6 Pink (odd years) 2.7 Sockeye "],["trends.html", "3 Trends 3.1 All species 3.2 Chinook 3.3 Chum 3.4 Coho 3.5 Pink (Even years) 3.6 Pink (Odd years) 3.7 Sockeye", " 3 Trends This section compares trends in escapements by Conservation Unit on all waterbodies selected for analysis by period.
